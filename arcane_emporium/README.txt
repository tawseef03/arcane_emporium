The name of the database is 'arcaneemporium' and the SQL file is in the sql folder.

The starting point of the website is '/html/mainpage.html'. As for now, the user has to login separately after signing up. Unfortunately, the loginsignup.html page does not match with the theme of the website because I did not get time to change the style after deciding on the theme.

There are two types of user for this website. Type '1' represents the admin and type '0' represents normal user. Every user that signs up will be assigned type '0' by default.

The website lets the admin  add, edit, and delete items as well as users. Users can only see the displayed products in the website but the 'Add to Basket' feature is not present.

Login info for admin:
username: admin
password: admin123
